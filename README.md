# IBM-Attrition-Prediction

# Project Description
The IBM Attrition Prediction Project is a machine learning endeavor aimed at identifying the likelihood of employee turnover. Utilizing IBM's employee dataset, the project entailed meticulous data preparation and cleaning, encompassing the treatment of missing values, encoding of categorical variables, and scaling of numerical features.

A comprehensive statistical analysis was conducted, accompanied by the creation of visualizations to decipher the dynamics between various variables. The pivotal aspect of the project was to pinpoint key features that have a pronounced correlation with employee attrition, thereby enabling targeted interventions.

The predictive modeling phase involved the application of Logistic Regression and Random Forest algorithms. The focus was on leveraging these models to forecast potential attrition, with a specific emphasis on refining the Random Forest model through hyperparameter optimization, as it outperformed its logistic counterpart.


# Problems Solved
This project addresses the critical issue of employee attrition, which can result in substantial costs and disruptions to an organization. By predicting which employees are at a higher risk of leaving, the company can implement preemptive measures to enhance retention, ultimately saving on hiring and training new personnel.

Various metrics from scikit-learn (accuracy_score, precision_score, etc.)

# Challenges Faced
* Data Preprocessing: Ensuring the integrity of the dataset by handling missing values and encoding categorical variables without introducing bias
* Feature Selection: Determining the most influential features that impact attrition without overfitting the model
* Model Optimization: Fine-tuning the Random Forest model's hyperparameters to maximize predictive accuracy while maintaining generalizability

# Future Implementations
* Exploring Additional Models: Investigate other machine learning models like Support Vector Machines (SVM) or neural networks for potentially improved prediction accuracy.
* Deployment: Develop a web application for real-time attrition prediction, enabling HR teams to make data-driven decisions promptly
* Continual Learning: Implement a system where the model can learn continuously as new data becomes available, enhancing its predictive capabilities over time
